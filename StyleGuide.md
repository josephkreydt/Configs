### File and Directory Names
- File and directory names should be free of whitespace to avoid having to quote or escape file paths in scripts.
- File and directory names should be consistent in style for readability and organization.
- Underscores require two key strokes, and extension of the ring finger, so I prefer to avoid them. To avoid underscores yet maintain readability, file and directory names should be written in PascalCase.
- To avoid underscores, but create more division than PascalCase, use dashes.
